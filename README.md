# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Purpose
The goal of this challenge was to use R to discover which variables predict the MPG for vehicle prototypes,
collect summary statistics on the PSI of suspension coils,
determine if manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population, and finally 
design a study to compare the MechaCar performance against vehicles from other manufacturers.
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables in our dataset that show a non-random effect on the MPG of the MechaCar are the Vehicle Length and the Ground Clearance. A linear regression model run on these variables against figures for MPG, resulted in p-values of 2.6x10-12 and 5.21x10-8, respectively. In addition, the intercept was also statistically significant.
